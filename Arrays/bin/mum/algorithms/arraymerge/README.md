Consider the following problem: As input you are given two sorted arrays of integers. Your objective is to design an algorithm that would merge the two arrays together to form a new sorted array that contains all the integers contained in the two arrays. For example, on input

[1, 4, 5, 8, 17], [2, 4, 8, 11, 13, 21, 23, 25]

the algorithm would output the following array:

[1,2,4,4,5,8,8, 11, 13, 17, 21, 23, 25]

For this problem, do the following:
A. Design an algorithm Merge to solve this problem and write your algorithm description using the pseudo-code syntax discussed in class.
B. Examining your pseudo-code, determine the asymptotic running time of this merge algorithm
C. Implement your pseudo-code as a Java method merge having the following signature:
`int[] merge(int[] arr1, int[] arr2)`

Be sure to test your method in a main method to be sure it really works!
